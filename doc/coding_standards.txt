# Coding standards of `libsc`

This file describes a list of coding standards that the SC Library
tries to adhere to.

## White space

   `libsc` is a `C` library.  We do not use `C++`-style comments `//`.
   Please use `/* ... */` throughout.

   All `.c` and `.h` files must be indented with the `scindent` script in
   the main directory.  It calls GNU `indent` with some extra options.
   This does not apply to included third party code.

   Different versions of `indent` produce different results.  When in doubt,
   please talk to us about various versions of `indent`.
   An essential rule of thumb is to throw away white space changes to lines of
   code not written by yourself.

   Where `./scindent` goes bad, use `/* *INDENT-OFF* */` and `-ON` comments.

   Use `doxygen` style for comments whenever possible.  We're aiming at a
   complete in-source documentation that runs through without warnings.
   Comments and code should not exceed the 79th column.

   We provide the `scspell` script for spell checking of comments.
   It calls `codespell`.

## Portability

   The code should be safe for C++ compilers.  This means that all .h
   files need to protect external declarations with `extern "C" { ... }`.
   `C++` also needs explicit casts in many places where `C` does not care.

   To test this, try

       relative/path/to/configure --enable-mpi --enable-debug CC=mpicxx \
           CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -O0 -g"

   and run `make -j V=0`.  Modify accordingly for production builds.

## Boolean variables

   All boolean parameters will not be checked with `(x==true)` or `(x==false)`.
   We follow the standard `C` convention where `(x)` is used to test true
   and `(!x)` is used to test false.  The `bool` type is never used; use `int`.
   An exception is to test explicitly for pointers being `NULL` or not,
   like `(p == NULL)` or `(p != NULL)`.

## Iteration variables

   Loop variables of type `int` can be named as usual: `i`, `j`, etc.
   Loop variables of type `size_t` should be named `iz`, `jz`, etc.
   Loop variables of type `ssize_t` should be named `is`, `js`, etc.
   There is usually no need to use any other type for loop counters.

## `printf` long integers

   We will have to wait until all compilers and some lint checkers
   understand

       printf ("%jd %ju", (intmax_t) i, (uintmax_t) u);

   since that would be a nice way to accommodate 128 bit integers without
   changing the `printf` code.
   This also holds for `size_t` since support for the following is still
   incomplete:

       printf ("%zd %zu", ssize_t_var, size_t_var);

   In the meantime, we're using:

       printf ("%lld %llu", (long long) verylongi, (unsigned long long) verylongu);

## Buffer sizes

   We never use variable-length buffer output such as produced by `sprintf`.

   What we do is calling safe versions like

       char buf[BUFSIZ];
       snprintf (buf, BUFSIZ, "Foo %d\n", bar);
