[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/3974693.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10838739)

## General

 - We have been reminded, for good reason, to maintain release notes.
 - Please record explicitly if there have been any breaking changes wrt. the
   software API or ABI.  In this case, we'll bump the libtool version with
   the next release version.  Please also note if there have been A*I
   extensions, in which case we'll bump the libtool minor version.
 - Please add an item with every contribution under *Next release* below.

## Next release

### Functionality

 - Fix extern "C" macro for using C++ compilers with libsc .c files
 - Add sc_MPI_Aint and sc_MPI_Aint_diff
 - Add sc_MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG, sc_MPI_SIGNED_CHAR and sc_MPI_INT8_T
 - Implement a functional subset of the scda API for parallel I/O
 - Intremental documentation updates

### Build system

 - Streamline CMake configuration
 - Make sure to use SC_ENABLE_* CMake variables
 - Adapt CMake CI to matrix of latest compilers
 - Check for MPI_Aint_diff in CMake and Autoconf
 - Check if MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG, MPI_SIGNED_CHAR and MPI_INT8_T are available
 - Fix tarball naming and add a CMake target to generate .tarball-version file

## 2.8.6

There have been breaking changes, very strictly speaking.

### Documentation

 - Begin maintaining a release notes file.
 - Add to documentation of sc_containers.h.
 - Completion and some polishing of the doxygen documentation in sc_io.h.
 - Add file-oriented data format, API and documentation, suitable for
   parallel, partition-independent disk I/O, in sc_scda.h.
 - Restructure the I/O module in the doxygen documentation.

### Build system

 - Bump library version according to libtool to 3:0:0.
 - No longer install getopt and puff original headers.
 - Make sc_getopt.h a purely internal header file.
 - Add a generic external library installation option.
 - Add script doc/p4est-build-wdeps.sh for autotools build.
 - Further align CMake with the autoconf build system.
 - Update CMake logic to configure zlib and jansson.
 - Add CMake option to run tests with Valgrind.
 - Warn if configuring MPI on and MPI I/O off.
 - Renaming of CMake build system variables
 - Make MPI checking functionality more robust in CMake.

### Functionality

 - Further align I/O wrappers with and without MPI.
 - Change the semantic of sc_io_open to always truncate a newly created file.
 - Simplify the replacements for MPI_{read,write}_at*.
 - Further updates to the MPI I/O wrapper code.
 - Deprecate the configuration with MPI but without MPI I/O.
 - Remove sc_io_{write,read}_all.
 - Add sc_io_source, sink_destroy_null functions.
 - Make sure not to sc_io_source_read an array beyond its length.
 - Add sc_io_file_load, save functions and test program.
 - Update sc_hash_array to hide much of internal state.
 - Update zlib and base64 encode/compression routines.
 - Remove the MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG datatype wrapper.

## 2.8.5

This was the last version without a release notes file.
