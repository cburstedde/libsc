/** \defgroup sc3 sc3
 * Version 3 of the sc library is new code.
 *
 * Earlier code up to version 2.x remains usable and supported.
 *
 * The main goals compared to previous versions are to improve the error
 * handling and to remove any global/static variables.
 * In particular, functions do no longer call `MPI_Abort()` on failed
 * assertions but return error objects.
 * These error objects can be returned all the way up to the toplevel code.
 * We have also introduced RAII objects and reference counting.
 * Memory allocation is wrapped into allocators that keep internal counts.
 * We do not provide any locking, thus it is recommended to create one
 * allocator per thread, and generally to work with a hierarchy of allocators.
 * We provide various data containers, for example variable-length arrays.
 *
 * There is no `sc3.h` file to include everything.
 * To just pull in the configuration and system headers, include \ref
 * sc3_base.h.
 * We removed the global initialization and finalize functions.
 * There is no more global state to the library.
 *
 * We use a minimal reference counting mechanism declared in \ref
 * sc3_refcount.h.  While the \ref sc3_refcount_t object is public, most
 * objects in \ref sc3 are opaque and manipulated by API functions only.
 *
 * Allocators are declared in \ref sc3_alloc.h, and errors in \ref sc3_error.h.
 * These two files depend on each other and, combined with the reference
 * counters, constitute the basis of the code.
 *
 * Containers are declared in \ref sc3_array.h and \ref sc3_memstamp.h.
 *
 * We use the C convention for boolean variables:
 * They are of type `int` and false if and only of their value is 0.
 * An application must be careful to interpret any non-negative number as true.
 *
 * The design we provide is not meant to reinvent object oriented programming.
 * It is a set of minimal conventions that establish a consistent call pattern
 * of the code.
 * - An object begins with its life with the `sc3_object_new` call and a
 *   reference count of 1.
 *   These functions usually take an allocator input parameter that is
 *   used to allocate the object and all future resources inside of it.
 * - After the `new` call, properties of the object may be specified by
 *   `sc3_object_set_*` functions.
 *   It is fine to call the same set function multiple times or to temporarily
 *   set conflicting values.
 *   In this stage, the object cannot yet be referenced, but it can be
 *   unreferenced and destroyed (which amount to the same result here).
 * - After setting a consistent set of parameters, call `sc3_object_setup`.
 *   This creates a usable object that can no longer be reparameterized,
 *   thus it is immutable and safe to be referenced and passed to other code.
 *   There may be exceptions to immutability, for example an array may be
 *   resized after setup, but the size of each element may not be changed.
 * - An object that is setup may be queried for properties set with
 *   sc3_object_get_*.
 *   These functions are generally tolerant to NULL output arguments.
 * - When removing an object's last reference with `sc3_object_unref`, it is
 *   deallocated together with all its internal resources.
 *   When calling unref, do not assume anything about the input reference
 *   count since other references may have been created and passed around.
 *   Likewise, it is generally unsafe to rely on the inout argument to unref,
 *   and best to consider an unrefd pointer to be no longer valid.
 * - The `sc3_object_destroy` functions must only be called if the program
 *   can guarantee that at this point the reference count is 1.
 *   In some situations, when we do not pass references to the object to
 *   other parts of the code, this is easy to enforce.
 *   Otherwise, it may be best not to use destroy and rely on unref entirely.
 * - There is no means to query the present reference count of an object.
 *   This is on purpose:  The whole point of reference counting is that
 *   different references to the object can be used independently.
 *   Again, this means that destroy functions should only be used with reason.
 * - The `sc3_object_is_*` functions implement queries that may be called for
 *   any pointer to this object type, including `NULL`, at any stage.
 *   They query properties of the object and always return false if the pointer
 *   is `NULL`.
 *   One convention is to generally provide for `sc3_object_is_new`,
 *   `sc3_object_is_setup` and `sc3_object_is_valid`, plus more as needed.
 *   The first two refer to the mutually exclusive phases of its lifetime,
 *   while the third may be used anytime to verify internal consistency.
