/** \file sc3_array.h \ingroup sc3
 * We provide an array of a variable count of same-size items.
 *
 * The array container stores any number of fixed-size items.
 * The length of the array (allocated number of items) can be changed.
 * If needed, memory is reallocated internally.
 * The array can serve as a push-and-pop stack.
 *
 * We use standard `int` types for indexing.
 * The total array memory size may be greater than 2 GB depending
 * on the size of each element.
 *
 * In the setup phase, we set the size of the array and optionally
 * an initial count, an initzero property, and some more.
 * The caller may also decide during setup if the array is resizable.
 * After setup, the array may be resized while it is resizable.
 * Resizability can be terminated by calling \ref sc3_array_freeze
 * (only after \ref sc3_array_setup).  The freeze is not reversible.
 *
 * We allow for arrays to be views on other arrays or plain data.
 * This provides for one unified way of indexing into any memory.
 * Views can be renewed quickly to optimize for this common case.
 *
 * The usual ref-, unref- and destroy semantics hold, except
 * an array can only be refd if it is setup and non-resizable.
