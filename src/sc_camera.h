/** \defgroup sc_camera Camera
 * \ingroup sc
 * 
 * A camera data structure for maintaining the position, orientation and
 * view frustum of the camera.
 * 
 * ## Example Workflow: Rendering a point p with sc_camera
 * 
 * 1. **World Space:**  
 *    Initially, \b p lies in the right-handed world coordinate system.
 * 
 * 2. **View Transformation:**  
 *    \b p is transformed into the right-handed view coordinate system.
 *    In this system:
 *    - The camera is at the origin, looking down the negative z-axis.
 *    - The x-axis points to the right, and the y-axis points upwards.
 * 
 *    Transformation steps:
 *    - Translate \b p by the camera position.
 *    - Rotate \b p by the camera rotation.
 * 
 *    The camera rotation is stored as a unit quaternion q = (q_x, q_y, q_z, q_w),
 *    where (q_x, q_y, q_z) are the imaginary parts (i, j, k) and q_w is the 
 *    real part.
 *
 *    To rotate a point \b p = (p_x, p_y, p_z), treat it as a pure quaternion 
 *    (p_x i + p_y j + p_z k), and compute the conjugation:
 *      p' = q * p * q^{-1}
 * 
 *    Explicitly:
 *      p' = (q_x i + q_y j + q_z k + q_w) * (p_x i + p_y j + p_z k) * (-q_x i - q_y j - q_z k + q_w)
 *    where quaternion multiplication rules apply (i.e., i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1).
 *    The camera rotation is defined such that it rotates the world space so 
 *    that the camera looks along the negative z-axis. It is the \b inverse of 
 *    the rotation that would align the default camera orientation with the 
 *    preferred camera direction.
 * 
 *    In summary, the view transformation is:
 *    
 *      p_view = q * (\b p - camera->position) * q^-1
 * 
 * 3. **Projection to Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC):**  
 *    After the view transformation, \b p is projected into normalized device 
 *    coordinates (NDC):
 *    - The x- and y-coordinates represent the 2D position of the point in the 
 *      image.
 *    - The z-coordinate represents depth information, which is used for
 *      visibility and rendering order.
 * 
 *    The NDC space is left-handed, as in OpenGL:
 *    - The visible region is the cube [-1, 1]^3.
 *    - (x, y) = (-1, -1) is the bottom-left corner of the image.
 *    - (x, y) = (1, 1) is the top-right corner of the image.
 *    - Increasing x moves to the right, increasing y moves upwards.
 *    - For the z-axis:
 *        - z = -1  corresponds to the near clipping plane (closest to the camera),
 *        - z = 1 corresponds to the far clipping plane (farthest from the camera).
 * 
 *    The projection is defined by:
 *    - The **horizontal field of view (FOV)**: the opening angle in radians in 
 *      the x-direction.
 *    - The **aspect ratio**: the ratio of image width to height, which 
 *      determines the vertical field of view.
 *    - The **near** and **far** values: the positive distances from the camera 
 *      to the near and far clipping planes.
 * 
 *    Points closer than the near plane or farther than the far plane are clipped, 
 *    meaning they are not mapped inside the visible cube [-1, 1]^3.
