 *
 * Routines for parallel I/O with the \b scda format.
 *
 * Functionality to write and read in parallel using a prescribed
 * serial-equivalent file format called \b scda.
 *
 * ### General
 *
 * The \b scda format is as in this
 * [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06789).
 *
 * However, in contrast to the preprint the API in this file provides the two
 * functions \ref sc_scda_fopen_write and \ref sc_scda_fopen_read instead of
 * providing one opening function with a mode parameter to decide and writing
 * and reading.
 *
 * In addition, we add in this file the options structure \ref
 * sc_scda_fopen_options as parameter for opening files.
 *
 * The file format includes
 * metadata in ASCII and therefore enables the human eye to parse the
 * file structure using a standard text editor.
 *
 * The file format \b scda is in particular suitable for parallel I/O and is
 * accompanied by a convention for element-wise compression.
 *
 * The format is designed such that the the parallel partition and in particular
 * the process count can differ between writing and reading.
 *
 * The main purpose of \b scda is to enable the user to implement parallel I/O
 * for numerical appliations, e.g. simulation checkpoint/restart.
 *
 * We elaborate further on the workflow in \ref scda_workflow.
 *
 * The \b scda functions do not support the deprecated configuration case of
 * MPI being enabled but MPI I/O being disabled. The functions \ref
 * sc_scda_fopen_write and \ref sc_scda_fopen_read abort in this case. All other
 * valid configurations are supported.
 *
 * ### User Strings
 *
 * The functions
 *
 * - \ref sc_scda_fopen_write,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_inline,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_block,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_array,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_varray,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fopen_read and
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_section_header
 *
 * have \b user_string and \b len as an argument.
 *
 * The user string consisting of the two parameters \b user_string and \b len is
 * always a collective parameter.
 *
 * In the case of writing these arguments have the purpose to pass the user
 * string that is written to the file.
 *
 * There are two options writing the user string to the file.
 *
 * 1. A nul-terminated string \b user_string, i.e. a standard C string. In this
 * case \b len is set to NULL since the length of \b user_string is implicitly
 * given by the nul-termination.
 *
 * 2. Arbitrary data for the user string including possible '\0' in
 * non-terminating positions. We still require nul-termination for safety.
 * One needs to explicitly pass the length, i.e. the number of bytes
 * excluding the nul-termination.
 *
 * For both options it must be respected that the number of maximal \b user_string
 * bytes is \ref SC_SCDA_USER_STRING_BYTES + 1 including the nul-termination.
 *
 * In case of reading \b user_string must be at least \ref
 * SC_SCDA_USER_STRING_BYTES + 1 bytes. On output \b len is set to the number
 * of bytes actually written to \b user_string excluding the nul-termination.
 *
 * If it is desired to write arbitrary data without the nul-termination, which
 * is required for the user string, one can write a block data section using
 * the function \ref sc_scda_fwrite_block.
 *
 * ### Encoding
 *
 * \b scda provides optional transparent, element-wise compression of data of
 * file sections.
 * The compression for writing can be enabled by passing true for \b encode to
 * one of the functions
 *
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_inline,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_block,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_array and
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_varray.
 *
 * The compression on writing can be decided by the user for each file section
 * separately. All parameters on the size of the data written to the file refer
 * to the uncompressed data.
 *
 * On reading it sufficies to pass \b decode true to the function \ref
 * sc_scda_fread_section_header. Then the file section data is decompressed
 * if it was compressed and otherwise the file section data is read raw.
 * Again all data sizes in reading functions refer to the uncompressed data.
 *
 * If \b decode is false, the data is read raw even if it was written according
 * to the compression convention.
 *
 * ### Error management
 *
 * All \b scda functions that receive a file context have an output parameter
 * called \b errcode. In case of an unsuccessful function call, the respective
 * function returns NULL instead of the file context and sets the output
 * parameter \b errcode to the respective error code. If such a case occurs,
 * the file that is associated to the used file context is closed and the file
 * context is deallocated.
 *
 * The error code can be examined by the user using the two functions
 * - \ref sc_scda_ferror_class and
 * - \ref sc_scda_ferror_string.
 *
 * If MPI is available \b errcode may encode an MPI error code. In this case
 * the two error examination functions output the error class and error string
 * as it would be output by the corresponding MPI functions, respectively.
 * Without MPI it is still possible that \b errcode encodes an I/O
 * operation related error code. This case does not differ concerning the error
 * code examiniation.
 * Moreover, \b errcode can encode an error code related to \b scda, i.e.
 * the I/O operations were successful but there is some violation of the \b scda
 * format, workflow or API.
 *
 * For more technical details on \b errcode see the documentation of \ref
 * sc_scda_ferror_t. Furthermore, the \b scda format, workflow or API errors
 * description can be found in the documentation of \ref sc_scda_ret.

/**
 * \page scda_workflow Parallel I/O workflow
 *
 * The general workflow for the scda format provided by \ref sc_scda.h
 *
 * All workflows start with \ref sc_scda_fopen_write or \ref sc_scda_fopen_read
 * that creates a file context \ref sc_scda_fcontext_t that never moves backwards.
 *
 * Then the user may call any combination of functions out of:
 *
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_inline,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_block,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_array and
 * - \ref sc_scda_fwrite_varray,
 *
 * for a context obtained from \ref sc_scda_fopen_write.
 *
 * Alternatively, after using \ref sc_scda_fopen_read the user must call
 * \ref sc_scda_fread_section_header that examines the current file section
 * and then call accordingly to the retrieved file section type one of
 *
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_inline_data,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_block_data,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_array_data,
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_varray_sizes and
 * - \ref sc_scda_fread_varray_data.
 *
 * Finally, the file context is collectively closed and deallocated by \ref
 * sc_scda_fclose.
 *
 * All above mentioned sc_scda functions are collective and output an
 * error code (cf. \ref sc_scda_ferror_t) that can be translated by \ref
 * sc_scda_ferror_string.
 *
 * For more details and the option for encoding metadata and data see the
 * functions in \ref sc_scda.h.
