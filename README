## Building `libsc`

The build instructions for `p4est` also apply to standalone builds of `libsc`.

### Autotools

The `autoconf`/`automake`/`libtool` build chain is fully supported.

In a fresh checkout, you may run `./bootstrap` to create the `configure`
script.  This is *not* required for unpacked `tar` archives, or after pulling
fresh code.

We recommend running `configure` with a relative path from an empty build
directory.  Try

    configure --help

for options and switches.  For development with MPI:

    cd empty/build/directory
    ../relative/path/to/configure --enable-mpi --enable-debug \
        CFLAGS="-O0 -g -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter"
    make -j8 V=0

The `V=0` environment variable significantly unclutters console output.

### CMake

For faster builds that work on Windows as well as MacOS and Linux, and
that are easily usable from other CMake projects, libsc can be built directly,
or used via FetchContent or ExternalProject from other CMake projects.

MPI is enabled by default:

    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build --parallel

To disable MPI:

    cmake -B build -Dmpi=no

To compile with debug options:

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Optionally, run self-tests:

    cd build
    ctest

Optionally, install `libsc` like:

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local
    cmake --install build

Here are a few compilers known to work with `libsc` via CMake:

* GCC or Clang (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
* Intel `icc` (Linux, MacOS)
* Intel NextGen LLVM `icx` (Linux, MacOS, Windows).

#### Distribution packages

For `libsc` developers, source and binary distribution packages are generated
after building `libsc` by:

    cpack --config build/CPackSourceConfig.cmake
    cpack --config build/CPackConfig.cmake

which creates files:

 * `build/package/SC-<version>-Source.zip` containing source code
 * `build/package/SC-<version>-<platform>.zip` containing binary libraries and
    exectuables suitable for computers of same operating system and compatible
    CPU arch
