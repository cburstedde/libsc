 * The current stable version 2 of the libsc code is maintained in branches
   v2.2--v2.5.  It will be backwards compatible as much as possible.
   The code will remain usable and bugfixed for the forseeable future.
   The branches master (official) and develop (fairly stable) live here.
 * We have introduced a new development branch leading up to v3.0.
   The initial version is v2.8.  The branch is called prev3-develop.  On
   v2.8+, we break the API as necessary to prepare the next major release.
 * We begin introducing #define for backwards compatibility queries.
   These defines are placed in src/sc.h.
   Please see the paragraph COMPATIBLIITY below for a list.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Compatibility #define variables in sc.h:

 * SC_INIT_COMM_CLEAN
   indicates that the communication is no longer modified in sc_init.
   The functionality is still there as an option; please see sc_mpi.h
   and look into the functions sc_mpi_comm_attach_node_comms and friends.
