title: Add ENABLE or WITH to SC_ARG defines
desc: |-
  The SC_ARG_ENABLE and SC_ARG_WITH macres use AC_DEFINE
  to define preprocessor macros.  Currently these macros
  do not include the ENABLE or WITH tokens which makes them
  different from the AC_CONDITIONALS which include them.
  Beware that this will require changes in dependent projects.
