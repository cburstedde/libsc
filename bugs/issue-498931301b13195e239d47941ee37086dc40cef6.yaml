title: Add C++ C99 Compatibility Layer for Complex Arithmetic
desc: |-
  We should use the approach laid out in [1] to write complex arithmetic
  code that can be compiled with C++ or C99.  To do this we would need to
  only include a small header file [2] in libsc.  Carsten suggested that we
  do not use abs for fabs and I do agree.  Note also that tgmath.h is a ISO
  C standard header (aka C99) [3].
